# ApexFinder Pro

A private OSINT intelligence platform for researching high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) via real public registries. **Zero synthetic data — every record is sourced from a validated public registry.**

---

## Architecture

pnpm monorepo (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` at root). Four registered artifacts:

| Artifact | Path | Port env | Preview path |
|---|---|---|---|
| API Server (Express 5) | `artifacts/api-server` | `PORT` (8080) | `/api` |
| Web Frontend (React 19 + Vite) | `artifacts/apex-finder` | `PORT` (23695) | `/` |
| Mobile (Expo) | `artifacts/apex-mobile` | `PORT` (22796) | `/apex-mobile/` |
| Mockup Sandbox | `artifacts/mockup-sandbox` | `PORT` (8081) | `/__mockup` |

Shared libraries (under `lib/`):
- `lib/db` — Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL schema. Run `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` to apply migrations.
- `lib/api-zod` — shared Zod request/response schemas

Phase J3 identity review data is stored in the `identity_bundles` and
`identity_candidates` tables. `POST /api/identity/resolve` builds deterministic
name variants and contextual cross-registry candidates; candidates remain
review-only and are never auto-merged or used to promote contacts.

## Target contact agent (2026-08-22) — card is the answer

**Tip on `main`:** `4fb6c9a` / `04bfa68` — agent-first contact recovery. Pull + **restart API**. Do not Launch until agent path is live.

### Contract
- **Agent-first:** when target agent fills phone/email, **parallel AI WEB OSINT is skipped** (no second dig overwriting judgment).
- **Per person:** `runTargetContactAgent` runs early in Atlas entity enrich (`atlas-orchestrator` → stage **TARGET CONTACT AGENT**).
- **Loop:** free ReAct in `agentic-web-research.ts` — model invents queries, visits pages, uses OSINT tools; no force-hop playbook.
- **Output:** best public phone/email/LinkedIn promoted onto `entities.*` + `contactOutcome` updated. Evidence rows are provenance, not the product.
- **Promote:** host-scored (`sec.gov` preferred; directory/wrong-issuer trash rejected). EDGAR issuer phones must not overwrite `agentic-web`.
- **Rehydrate without re-dig:** `POST /api/entities/rehydrate-contacts` `{ "limit": 50 }` or `{ "entityId": N }`.
- **Stuck jobs:** status poll auto-fails Atlas runs older than 90 minutes; `POST /api/ingest/atlas-stop` or `DELETE /api/ingest/atlas-lock`.

### Operator sequence
1. `git pull origin main`
2. Restart **API Server** workflow (esbuild rebuild)
3. Rebuild UI if needed: `pnpm --filter @workspace/apex-finder run build`
4. Stop any zombie job → optional rehydrate → one Launch
5. Confirm cards show dig-backed phones (not only empty / permanent EDGAR-Phone when evidence exists)

### Desk UI honesty
- Header keys: ApiKeyHealth falls back to `/api/healthz` so Overview and ledger agree.
- Status page lists only **live** AI pools (no empty Perplexity in the live banner).
- Connections/Network: lazy force-graph + ErrorBoundary (never pure black shell).

### Living handoff
Full tip chain and philosophy: **`docs/context.md`**.

## Workflows (Replit-managed)

| Workflow | Command | Must run? |
|---|---|---|
| Redis | `redis-server --port 6379 --save '' --appendonly no` | Yes — local cache |
| `artifacts/api-server: API Server` | `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` | Yes |
| `artifacts/apex-finder: web` | `pnpm --filter @workspace/apex-finder run dev` | Yes |
| `artifacts/apex-mobile: expo` | `pnpm --filter @workspace/apex-mobile run dev` | Optional |
| `artifacts/mockup-sandbox: Component Preview Server` | `pnpm --filter @workspace/mockup-sandbox run dev` | Optional |

The API server `dev` script runs `build` then `start` every time (esbuild, ~1.5s). The build entry is `artifacts/api-server/src/src/index.ts`; the top-level `src/` tree is an import-era health-only scaffold and must not be used as the production entry.

The dashboard uses two deliberately separate scores: **Signal** reflects the strength of wealth/registry evidence, while **Access** reflects how realistically a profile can be reached through public contact evidence and directness. A strong Signal score must not imply a strong Access score.

The Intelligence Reactor's durable activity feed is sourced from target-scoped Atlas telemetry events appended to the Redis job log. Event payloads contain sanitized summaries only; provider output, usernames, and search hits remain review evidence and do not bypass identity, attribution, reachability, or contact-promotion gates.

The previously used Warren Buffett record is not a valid benchmark: celebrity visibility makes it unrealistically reachable. The valid controlled benchmark is a 16-person FAA aircraft-owner cohort selected from real individual turbine/multi-engine registrants, excluding Buffett, trusts, companies, obvious wrappers, and malformed names. The pre-fix run completed 16/16 with 0 errors at 13 social-only / 1 direct-contact candidate / 2 no usable contact outcomes; the stricter post-fix rerun completed 16/16 with 0 errors at 10 social-only / 0 direct-contact candidates / 6 no usable contact outcomes. Broad ingestion remains disabled unless explicitly requested.

### Controlled FAA benchmark (verified 2026-08-02)

- FAA import: 5,000 real registry records, 0 errors; no synthetic entities were seeded.
- Cohort: 16 less-famous, business-linked individual owners; target selection excluded celebrity/public-figure benchmarks and non-person wrappers.
- Funnel: post-fix 16/16 enriched, 10 social-only, 0 direct-contact candidates, 6 no usable contact outcomes; 6 HNWI social fields were promoted only after current-run attribution checks.
- Durable evidence: 431 contact-evidence rows across the cohort, including organization and person-candidate review evidence that was not promoted.
- Evidence rule: organization accounts, same-name/public-figure candidates, AI-only citations, and provider agreement without exact canonical claim URLs remain durable review evidence only.
- Attribution hardening: only current-run social candidates with target-person attribution and an exact fetched claim URL can reach HNWI contact fields or trigger Maigret/Sherlock; legacy entity handles are never used as scan fallbacks.
- Run safety: active-job ownership checks prevent orphaned workers from overlapping replacements or clearing a newer job lock.
- Claim-source hardening: lead-generation/directory publishers are excluded from direct-contact corroboration and bounded exact-claim fetching. A controlled three-target canary completed 3/3 with 0 errors and 0/3 verified direct routes; it improved provenance quality without producing a false contact promotion.
- Honest status: the pipeline is materially safer and provenance-correct, but this cohort does **not** establish a 9/10 research score. Post-fix direct-contact yield is 0/16; 10 social-only and 6 no-usable-contact records require further lawful, evidence-backed access work.

## Contact Enrichment Roadmap

The long-term plan for improving the approximately 2.5% direct-contact yield is maintained as **Phase J** in `improvements.md`. It is designed to be implemented across future re-imports in gated milestones: measure the enrichment funnel, keep social-only records eligible for direct-contact follow-up, expand lawful Western registry coverage, resolve identities and official domains, validate candidate contacts, run budgeted multi-pass discovery, and use the relationship graph for contextual research. Phase J describes lawful public methods and is intentionally not a current production source allowlist or capacity restriction. Sources may be internally marked `productionReviewStatus: review_required` for later public-production review, but that marker must not restrict private research. Production limits and public-facing safeguards are deferred to a separate release-hardening phase. Only lawful public data with provenance may be promoted to verified contact; organization, social, evidence-only, and direct-contact outcomes remain separate.

## Environment Variables & Secrets

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Replit PostgreSQL (auto) | PostgreSQL connection |
| `REDIS_URL` | `.replit` userenv | Local Redis — `redis://localhost:6379` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Replit Secret | Express session signing |
| `REDIS_URL_1`–`REDIS_URL_5` | Replit Secrets | **Upstash permanent Redis slots** — dedup/contact-cache capacity is distributed across the numbered slots; slot 1 is currently quota-exhausted and skipped automatically, while slots 2–5 are healthy. |
| `COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY` | Replit Secret (optional) | UK Companies House officer harvester |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`, `_1`–`_10` | Replit Secrets (optional) | Groq-powered structured extraction during web enrichment, with key rotation |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `_2`–`_6` | Replit Secrets (optional) | Perplexity-powered public web discovery and enrichment, with key rotation |
| `WHOXY_API_KEY` | Replit Secret (optional) | Optional reverse-WHOIS enrichment; free RDAP, DNS, certificate-transparency, and archive sources remain the required domain-intelligence path |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Replit Secret (optional) | Mistral Conversations API web-search lane for explicitly started, review-only Bureau discovery; guarded to 1 request/second |
| `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY` | Replit Secret (optional) | NVIDIA NIM `z-ai/glm-5.2` right-hand advisory lane for the Gemini Boss; case-file reasoning only, no web search or contact promotion |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Replit Secret (optional) | Hugging Face Open Deep Research model adapter |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Replit Secret (optional) | Google-backed Serper search tool used by the bounded Hugging Face adapter |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `_2`, `_3`, `_4` | Replit Secrets (optional) | OpenRouter model access, with key rotation |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `_1`–`_10` | Replit Secrets (optional) | Google Gemini access with key rotation; the Boss inspects the model catalog and uses the current Interactions API with Google Search grounding |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_11`–`_13` | Replit Secrets (optional) | Dedicated Gemini Deep Research Pro Preview pool; participates as a bounded web-OSINT provider lane and remains isolated from Flash-Lite quota |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Replit Secret (optional) | Hugging Face inference for the bounded `smolagents` Open Deep Research provider lane |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Replit Secret (optional) | Serper live public-web search tool used by the Hugging Face Open Deep Research lane |
| `HF_DEEP_RESEARCH_MODEL` | Shared environment (optional) | Hugging Face model override; defaults to `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` for bounded latency |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `_2`–`_6` | Replit Secrets (optional) | Tavily AI-native search API; returns clean excerpts fed into Groq for extraction, with key rotation. `_6` is the fresh-quota slot; 432 quota responses are circuit-broken until the next API refresh |
| `EXA_API_KEY`, `_2` | Replit Secrets (optional) | Exa neural/semantic search; excels at people + company lookups; fed into Groq for extraction, with key rotation |
| `ENABLE_AUTO_PIPELINE` | Shared environment | `true` — enables the serialized, discovery-first Atlas controller. It starts immediately after startup maintenance, waits for each bounded cycle to finish, then starts the next cycle after 30 minutes. Set to `false` only when intentionally pausing automatic research. |

### Adding a new Upstash Redis slot

When any slot hits its 500,000-request free quota, add a fresh Upstash database as the next numbered slot:

1. Create a new database at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com) → copy its Redis URL (`rediss://...`)
2. Add it as a Replit Secret: `REDIS_URL_5`, `REDIS_URL_6`, etc. (continue the sequence)
3. Restart the **API Server** workflow — the slot scanner (`REDIS_URL_1` → `REDIS_URL_9`) picks it up automatically, no code changes needed
4. Confirm the new slot appears in the startup logs: `Permanent Redis connected slot: N`

The exhausted slot will keep retrying in the background (non-fatal); healthy slots are preferred automatically by `getPermanentClient()`.

## Replit Setup Notes (2026-07-24)

After a fresh GitHub import, run these steps to get the project running:

1. **Install dependencies:** `CI=true pnpm install` (takes ~4 min on first run; subsequent runs are fast)
2. **Push DB schema:** `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`
3. **Start workflows:** Redis → `artifacts/api-server: API Server` → `artifacts/apex-finder: web` (in that order)

Latest verification (2026-08-04): numbered provider secret slots `GROQ_API_KEY_1` through `_10` and `GEMINI_API_KEY_1` through `_10` are present; the unnumbered base keys are absent by design, and secret values were not read or displayed. The running API discovers all 20 numbered slots. API/Redis/web health is green. The prior Atlas job `695d3303-413a-48ac-af0c-7930890dd110` was killed by an API restart during Phase 8/J4; replacement job `6690ff6c-9dcc-47e6-a6df-44ae463505a4` completed successfully with 0 errors. Tavily and other provider quota/auth responses remain fail-closed and non-fatal. Phase 0 OpenOwnership and Foundation Filing stages publish target-scoped events for the Reactor with numeric ownership counts. The mobile Reactor shows a live target-scoped research console and labels temporary provider 429 cooldowns as configured-key rotation rather than exhausted secrets. Safe persona remediation has reconciled 425 entities cumulatively and applied 114 deterministic findings; the latest contact-research pass processed both eligible HNWI targets with 0 errors, and final persona review produced 0 new suggestions. Persona reruns suppress duplicate findings; wealth scores cannot imply hot access; full contact-state reconciliation and visible finding cleanup are live.

Contact-quality hardening completed: human-name admission is fail-closed behind deterministic safety gates; AI and enrichment paths no longer construct email addresses; email/phone/social values are sanitized before every PostgreSQL, evidence, Redis, cache-restore, startup-maintenance, and merge write; confidence and hot status are recomputed from cleaned vectors rather than trusted incoming scores; organization contacts cannot inflate personal Access confidence; `isHot` requires a meaningful person-level direct contact signal; and aircraft/property/shareholder/live-flight evidence no longer creates Access-hot leads. Wealth/registry evidence remains available as Signal.

Intelligence Reactor UI hardening completed: the desktop rod wall now displays all eight registry rods (including BRREG and WHOXY) and highlights live route segments from active endpoints; mobile now uses the same complete tool network in a responsive SVG panel with visible forward and adaptive-feedback routes, phase purpose readouts, and all 26 tool rods. The mobile view also leads with a live target-scoped research console showing current target, phase/queue progress, operation, research lanes, and evidence-aware results; the pipeline map is secondary context. Atlas now provides separate phase and entity-batch telemetry, with truthful 0–10 phase state, current entity names/range, and shared completed/active/queued/skipped/failed rod semantics on desktop and mobile. Idle mode does not simulate waves or light rods from historical sessions. No ingestion or pipeline behavior changed.

HNWI/entity card UX updated: dashboard priority cards, People ledger cards, and profile heroes now show an evidence-led public profile brief plus involvement summary using stored bios, headlines, foundation signals, registry activity, and linked assets. Missing evidence is labeled as unrecorded; no biography or involvement is invented. The hot-lead API contract includes the narrative fields and was regenerated from OpenAPI.

Research evidence hardening completed: provider output is reconciled into reviewable contact candidates keyed by normalized vector, with canonical source URLs/domains, organization-vs-person scope, attribution, conflicts, and explicit promotion states. Candidate funnel metadata is persisted through existing `contact_evidence` rows and shown on the Research desk. The independent scorecard separates identity, ownership, contact, practical access, wealth, freshness, and source quality; provider repetition, asset/graph volume, and wealth cannot promote access or verified contact. `/research` is registered and API route coverage is verified after bundling the full imported source tree. No ingestion or research job runs automatically.

The adaptive research director is now part of canonical web enrichment. It runs a bounded target-scoped pre-pass, chooses the next identity/structure/official-route/person-follow-up/claim-verification/provider-lane action from current evidence gaps, feeds new domains and names into exact-page research, and stops on evidence sufficiency or stalled progress. Adaptive provider output is review-only until the existing exact-page, attribution, corroboration, and reachability gates pass. The compact action trace is persisted with the investigator plan and yield metrics. Full API tests (40 files / 267 tests), production build, API restart, and Redis-healthy `/api/healthz` verification passed on 2026-08-06; no benchmark was run.

The Case Bureau now sits on top of that adaptive foundation. `research_cases` stores one living discovery-first or target-scoped case with objective, motivation, director mode, iteration, current action, and a serialized shared case file; `research_case_events` is append-only for decisions, assignments, observations, status changes, and human directives. Discovery cases have no `targetEntityId`: the Gemini Boss opening brief turns the human mission into a text-only planning brief, and search-capable investigators handle web/registry discovery separately; only a reviewed candidate is promoted into target-scoped research. Gemini is the Head Investigator: plain `generateContent` text generation chooses bounded next actions, writes investigator prompts, selects only approved tools from the action, and produces source-discipline restrictions. NVIDIA NIM GLM-5.2 is Gemini's right-hand advisor: it may recommend an existing action over the case file, but its recommendation is advisory and never directly changes the Boss's queue decision. The local Boss planner is the safe fallback. The Research desk exposes the discovery brief before entity selection, then the Boss target-case status, right-hand advisory, Boss plan, investigator prompt, tools, restrictions, directives, evidence counts, and a broad ranked contact hierarchy for human review. The bureau layer does not promote contacts, infer identity, or generate outreach.

The case flow was live-tested on 2026-08-06 with one clearly labeled synthetic fixture and then cleaned up. The temporary entity was deleted and foreign-key cascade verification returned zero matching entity, case, and event rows. No synthetic data remains in the development database.

Two fixes were needed after the first import:
- Added `"pg-cloudflare"` to the `external` list in `artifacts/api-server/build.mjs` (pg optional dep that esbuild couldn't resolve)
- Added `sharp`, `onnxruntime-node`, `protobufjs` to `onlyBuiltDependencies` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so their native bindings build correctly (sharp is needed by `@huggingface/transformers` at startup)

## Current Data State (historical benchmark vs active controlled runtime, verified 2026-08-03)

The benchmark figures below are historical results from the prior populated runtime. The current development database contains only records produced by the explicitly authorized controlled Atlas run; no synthetic records were seeded.

| Source | Entities | Assets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Western HNWI + FAA controlled import | 5,036 | 5,000 | 35 Western records plus 5,000 FAA aircraft-owner records; no synthetic data. |
| FAA benchmark enrichment | 16 | — | Post-fix run completed 16/16 with 0 errors: 10 social-only, 0 direct-contact candidates, 6 no usable contact outcomes; 431 durable evidence rows. Follow-up three-target claim-source canary: 3/3, 0 errors, 0/3 verified direct routes. |
| **Current verified state after overnight Atlas** | **22 visible / 0 hidden** | **20** | API and Redis healthy; the mixed-discovery run inserted 7 records, skipped 0, and reported 0 errors. |
| **Current controlled development runtime** | **6 visible / 0 hot** | **5** | 0 relationships, 0 active research-review sessions, 0 personal contactable routes, 1 organization route, and no validated or promoted personal direct contacts; the latest bounded Atlas pass is idle. |

**Background-run state:** `ENABLE_AUTO_PIPELINE=false` is set in the shared environment. Automatic startup scheduling and recurring background discovery/research are paused; Atlas runs only when explicitly launched. The durable contact-promotion validator, current-run evidence boundary, active-job ownership guard, candidate-attribution gate, and Access/Signal separation remain in place. Provider quota and plan limits reduce usable lanes, but fail-closed behavior preserves review-only outcomes.

**Atlas audit state:** Discovery admission and target processing are strictly sequential, and `targetCount` is a run-wide admission cap: a one-target launch cannot admit one candidate per source round. Each admitted candidate is processed before the next source starts, and final target review runs before research publication, contact promotion, and new asset publication. Broad search prompts constrain geography, person-level business evidence, and source quality while retaining selected global wealth hubs. The current API runtime reports Holehe, Maigret, and Sherlock available from `.pythonlibs/bin/python3`.

**Honest rating for this case study:** the API and web dashboard are healthy; targeted web research completed; official organization evidence was captured; collision-prone contact evidence and generated outreach remain manual-review only. The benchmark demonstrates correctness and provenance hardening, not 9/10 access quality. The stricter post-fix result is the authoritative benchmark result.

**Contact provenance state:** `entities.phone_source` is the nullable source-of-truth column for registry-phone classification. Legacy metadata markers were backfilled into this column, and 19 EDGAR/Companies House phone rows are organization-only with confidence 0 and `is_hot=false`. Generic HNWI search/page extraction is review-only `person_candidate` evidence unless an explicit target claim or exact fetched claim page establishes target-person scope.

## Ingestion Endpoints

All jobs are background — POST returns `{jobId}`, poll with `GET /api/ingest/job/:jobId`.

| Endpoint | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/ingest/faa` | FAA ReleasableAircraft.zip | Downloads ~70MB ZIP, extracts MASTER.txt (314,848 lines). Uses in-memory dedup + batch Upstash writes. ~73s for 30,000 records. |
| `POST /api/ingest/land-registry` | HMLR PPD bulk CSV (S3) | Downloads `pp-YYYY.csv` (~160MB/year) via `curl -L`. Streams, filters £1M+. Uses in-memory dedup. ~8min for 50,000 records. |
| `POST /api/ingest/western-hnwi` | SEC EDGAR + BRREG Norway + Companies House | Live API calls. Slow (~1 req/s rate limit). |
| `POST /api/ingest/occrp` | OCCRP Aleph + official OFAC SDN XML | Enrichment only — OCCRP is preferred; OFAC is a free sanctions-evidence fallback and never creates personal access. |
| `POST /api/ingest/opensky` | Public live ADS-B (`adsb.lol`, OpenSky fallback) | Live flight enrichment using aircraft registration matching. |
| `DELETE /api/ingest/dedup` | — | Clears the Upstash dedup set. Use before full re-ingest. |

Body params (all optional): `{ "force": true }` — bypasses cache and re-downloads source files.

## Contact Cache Architecture

**Purpose:** persist enriched contact data (email / phone / LinkedIn) across GitHub imports and DB resets.

- Contact cache lives in **Upstash slot 2** (`REDIS_URL_2`). Key format: `contact:v1:{stableKey}` where `stableKey = sourceRegistries[0]` (e.g. `contact:v1:edgar:cik12345`, `contact:v1:faa:N12345`). Keys are derived from source registry IDs — stable and collision-free across any import.
- **Write path (ingest.ts):** after every successful in-house enrichment DB write, `contactCacheSet(stableKey, data)` mirrors the same `CachedContact` payload to Redis. Fire-and-forget — no latency impact.
- **Restore path (startup.ts, step 0a):** on every boot, `contactCacheScanAll()` fetches all `contact:v1:*` keys, matches each to an entity via `sourceRegistries LIKE %stableKey%`, and backfills contact fields for any entity that currently has none. This restores prior enrichment into a freshly reset DB.
- **Backfill path (startup.ts, step 0b):** on every boot, reads all PostgreSQL entities with existing contact data and writes them to Redis if not already cached. Captures enrichments done before the Redis-mirror code was deployed.
- Helpers live in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/redis.ts`: `contactCacheSet`, `contactCacheGet`, `contactCacheScanAll`, `contactCacheCount`, `getContactCacheClient`.

---

## Dedup Architecture

**Critical:** dedup is what prevents duplicate rows across runs.

- Dedup set lives in **Upstash** (permanent Redis, `REDIS_URL_1`). Key: `apex:apex:dedup:hnwi` (double-prefix is a historical artifact — do not change).
- During ingestion, `preloadDedupPrefix(prefix)` in `lib/job-queue.ts` scans existing keys for a given prefix (e.g. `"faa:"`) into a local `Set<string>` — **one Upstash round-trip at start, not one per record**.
- After each batch flush, `batchMarkSeen(keys[])` writes new keys to Upstash in one `SADD` call.
- **Never use the old `isDuplicate()` / `markSeen()` pattern inside a parse loop** — at 75ms/call × 865 matches per 5k lines it stalls indefinitely.
- The Western HNWI ingestor still uses the old per-record pattern (acceptable at 200 records; fix if volume scales).

FAA dedup key format: `faa:NNUMBER` (e.g. `faa:N12345`)
Land Registry dedup key format: `lr:{transaction-uuid}`
Western HNWI dedup key format: `{normalizedname}:{jurisdiction}` (e.g. `johnsmith:us`)

## Data Integrity Rules

1. **No synthetic data anywhere.** If a field is unknown, it is `null` or omitted — never filled with plausible-sounding invented values.
2. `mock-data.ts` has been deleted. It contained 27 fictional profiles and was dead code, but posed a risk.
3. The Live Signals panel on the dashboard uses **real asset data** from the database — the most recent asset description + source registry for each entity. No random strings.
4. The MCTS agent (`lib/mcts-agent.ts`) does pure graph traversal on real DB relationships — it invents no data.
5. The persona engine (`lib/persona-engine.ts`) runs deterministic TypeScript rules against real entity fields — no AI APIs.

---

## Land Registry Notes

- **SPARQL is dead for bulk queries.** The HMLR PPD SPARQL endpoint at `https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/landregistry/query` returns empty results or HTTP 000 timeouts for any `pricePaid >= 1000000` filter. Use the bulk CSV instead.
- CSV URL: `http://prod.publicdata.landregistry.gov.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pp-YYYY.csv` (redirects to `prod2`). Use `curl -L`.
- PPD CSV has no header row. Fields: `[0]` tx UUID, `[1]` price, `[2]` date (`YYYY-MM-DD 00:00`), `[3]` postcode, `[4]` property type, `[6]` tenure, `[7-13]` address components, `[14]` PPD category (skip `B`), `[15]` record status (skip `D`).
- **Buyer identity is not in the PPD CSV.** Entities are named by property address, not buyer name.

---

## FAA Registry Notes

- ZIP downloaded from `https://registry.faa.gov/database/ReleasableAircraft.zip` (~70MB). Cached at `/tmp/apexfinder-faa/`.
- MASTER.txt: comma-delimited, 35 fields, latin1 encoding, Windows line endings (`\r\n`). Header row on line 1 — skip it.
- Field indices (0-based): `[0]` N-number, `[5]` typeReg, `[6]` name, `[9]` city, `[10]` state, `[14]` country, `[18]` typeAircraft, `[19]` typeEngine, `[20]` status.
- Status `V` = valid/registered. Filter: status ∈ {V,A}, typeReg ∈ {1,2,4,7,9} (non-government/non-airline), typeEngine ∈ {2,3,4,5} (turbine) OR typeAircraft ∈ {5=multi,6=rotorcraft}.
- ~865 qualifying records per 5,000 lines = ~51,000 total qualifying records in the full file.

| 7 | Persona improvement loop (11 deterministic personas: 8 core specialists plus User / Principal Operator, Development Team, and OSINT Specialists Team), `improvement_logs` table, `/improvements` UI page; Atlas Phase J runs the same review after each persisted target checkpoint |
| 8 | OCCRP Aleph enricher, HMLR OCOD ingestor (replaced by PPD CSV), OpenSky live-flight enricher, Data Sources dashboard |
| 9 (UX) | Single-pass query expansion (`expandQuery` in agent-orchestrator.ts); Entity Ledger evidence vectors; Profile research review; Intel Terminal search bar + 500-entity limit + `?entity=` URL pre-selection; `improve/run` inArray SQL fix; Intel Systems Analyst persona text updated to reflect expansion mechanics |
| 10 | **Redis contact cache** — enriched contacts now persist across GitHub imports and DB resets. `REDIS_URL_2` (Upstash slot 2) stores `contact:v1:{stableKey}` entries permanently. Startup restore (Redis → PG) and backfill (PG → Redis) steps run on every boot. Enricher mirrors to Redis after every DB write. |
| 11 | **Pipeline recovery hardening** — stale queued Hybrid Research locks are invalidated safely; shared public-email validation rejects search-engine diagnostics/placeholders; boot sanitation repairs PostgreSQL and Redis contact records; verified two 300-session research passes plus a fresh 100-entity Persona Loop pass with 0 errors. |
| 12 | **Phase H complete + full audit** — pipeline inverted (web-first), recurring scheduler (7 jobs forever), 3 enrichment modules (social-discovery, messenger-discovery, foundation-filings), 9 new schema columns, 8-vector contact panel UI. Full audit pass: confirmed all Phase H modules exist and route correctly; fixed 2 bugs: (1) `research.tsx` terminal placeholder "MCTS" → "UCT" (user-facing string); (2) `ingest-enrichment.ts` foundation-filings `db.select()` was missing all 5 social columns, causing `computeContactConfidence` to systematically undercount social signals. No other user-facing MCTS strings exist. All 300/300 Hybrid Research sessions and 100-entity Persona Loop pass with 0 errors verified. |
| 13 | **Same-source duplicate review** — `/duplicates` separates cross-registry candidates from exact-name clusters within normalized registries; new read-only cluster API and regression coverage prevent self-pairs and automatic merges. |
| 14 | **Measured warm-path recovery + enrichment correctness** — EDGAR issuer backfill, co-investor/co-shareholder detection, corporate-series/name-cluster edges, FAA/HMLR peer edges, and the website/address-only enrichment state fix. |
| J-1 (Phase J) | **J0 Measurement Contract + J1 Non-terminal social state** — `contactOutcome` column on entities (`none`/`evidence_only`/`social_only`/`organization_contact`/`direct_contact_candidate`/`direct_contact_verified`); `enrichment_runs` table for per-run funnel metrics; `computeContactOutcome()` in `contact-confidence.ts`; `GET /api/pipeline/funnel` with breakdown by registry/type; `POST /ingest/backfill-contact-outcomes`; FunnelPanel UI on Data Sources page. J1 fix: `needsEnrichment=false` only on email/phone — LinkedIn/Twitter no longer falsely mark entities as done. No research restrictions; production safeguards deferred to release-hardening. |
| J-2 (Phase J) | **Western registry coverage matrix** — live normalized search adapters for Norway BRREG, Czechia ARES, and France BODACC; provenance and identifier validation; fixture-style normalization tests; Data Sources coverage matrix with jurisdiction, access, freshness, ownership/officer scope, and non-blocking production review status. |
| J-3–J-9 (Phase J) | **Identity, domain, footprint, attribution, retry, graph, and source-quality hardening** — identity bundles/candidates remain review-only; domains and public digital footprints are resolved with cooldowns; contact attribution uses independent evidence dimensions; graph/MCTS paths carry provenance; source-quality/checkpoint APIs expose audit state. Phase J also publishes target/stage/tool/result telemetry and the Atlas status endpoint mirrors its separate worker snapshot for the Reactor. |
| Research provenance | **Fail-closed candidate evidence** — exact fetched page URLs and registry records are the provenance unit; flattened search snippets and aggregate AI extraction remain capped review signals; independent publisher domains corroborate, while contradictory values from one publisher remain disputed. |
| Username discovery | **Maigret primary + Sherlock fallback** — Sherlock is availability-checked and review-only, runs only when Maigret is unavailable/sparse, and cannot promote identity/contact fields or trigger automatic re-entry. |
| Atlas publication gate | **Final target-scoped web/LLM sanity review** — exact supplied evidence only; research-only targets cannot promote contacts; organization/person scope is enforced; rejected evidence and reasons remain reviewable. |
| Runtime verification | **Controlled benchmark complete** — API/Redis/web are healthy and no continuous Atlas cycle is running (`ENABLE_AUTO_PIPELINE=false`). The Amaron Helsingborg Topasen 7 AB benchmark completed 1/1 with 0 errors: `amaron.se` and Amaron Real Estate AB remain in the research plan; Martin Mildner, Stefan Wilhelmson, and Kjell Rudsby are review-only named executive routes; shared operator mailboxes remain organization-only. |

## User Preferences

- Zero synthetic/fake/hallucinated data at all times. Missing data = `null` or blank field.
- Deterministic TypeScript for AI-like features — no external AI APIs.
- Maintain existing pnpm monorepo structure.
- Use Fable 5 High Effort (built-in agent model) for any AI feature implementation — not external OpenAI/Anthropic calls.
- During long-running Atlas work, keep chat updates to a single `.` only; prioritize uninterrupted research, data-quality control, and Reactor improvements.

## Agent Rules (Absolute — apply every session)

1. **Read `replit.md` AND `Context.md` at the start of every session**, especially after any GitHub import. These two files together define current environment state and project intent. Never skip this step.

2. **Update `Context.md` after every meaningful iteration** before finishing a turn:
   - Update the "Current State" section (env vars, workflow status, DB counts)
   - Append a row to the Iteration Log with today's date and a one-line summary of what changed

3. **Update `replit.md` whenever** project-level facts change:
   - New environment variables or secrets added → update the table
   - DB record counts change after ingestion → update "Current Data State"
   - New phases/features implemented → append to "Phases Implemented"
   - Schema changes → update "Database Schema"

4. **Both files must be committed to the repo** as part of any task that changes project state. They are the permanent record of how this project runs.

5. **Python OSINT tools MUST be installed and verified on every session start and after every re-import** (PERMANENT — survives repo re-imports):
   - The project uses the managed Python 3.11 module and `.pythonlibs/bin/python3` when available.
   - Run `bash scripts/install-python-tools.sh` immediately after `pnpm install` and `db push`.
   - Verify output/logs show `holehe: ✓`, `maigret: ✓`, and `sherlock: ✓` before triggering any research.
   - This is now also wired into `scripts/post-merge.sh` (step 4) and `startup.ts` (auto-installs on boot).
   - **The app must not begin research if any tool is not ready.** If tools are missing, run the install script and wait for it to complete before proceeding.

6. **The enrichment pipeline is flexible — not a strict linear sequence** (PERMANENT — survives re-imports):
   - **Web-OSINT runs FIRST** (it is the primary AI layer: Perplexity, Gemini, Tavily, Exa, Groq in parallel).
   - **In-house enrichment runs SECOND** to fill gaps from free sources (Wikidata, EDGAR, CH, DNS, RDAP).
   - **Maigret runs THIRD** (auto-triggered inside web-osint-enrich job) whenever a social handle is discovered.
   - **Web-OSINT re-runs** automatically if Maigret finds 3+ cross-platform profiles — Maigret output becomes extra context for the AI.
   - **Holehe runs in parallel with Maigret** whenever an email is known.
   - Any phase can be re-triggered at any point. Never treat the pipeline as one-way. New signals at any stage should feed back into earlier phases.
