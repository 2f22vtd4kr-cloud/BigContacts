# ============================================================
# ApexFinder Pro — Post-Merge / Cold-Start Setup
#
# Runs automatically after every GitHub import merge.
# Safe to run repeatedly (idempotent).
#
# What this does:
#   1. Installs all pnpm workspace dependencies
#   2. Applies any new DB schema columns/tables (additive only)
#   3. Verifies no synthetic data crept in
#
# What happens automatically AFTER this (on API server boot):
#   - Ghost active-job locks from the previous process are cleared
#   - If the DB is empty, FAA + Land Registry + Western HNWI
#     ingestion start automatically (see src/lib/startup.ts)
#
# IMPORTANT — Upstash dedup across imports:
#   The Upstash dedup set (apex:dedup:hnwi) persists across imports.
#   If FAA inserts 0 records after a fresh import, it means all records
#   are already in the dedup set from a prior session.
#   To re-ingest from scratch: DELETE /api/ingest/dedup  (clears the set)
#   The cold-start auto-ingestion does NOT clear dedup — it respects it.
#
# Secrets needed (set once in Replit Secrets, persist across imports):
#   SESSION_SECRET          — Express session signing
#   REDIS_URL_1             — Upstash Redis (dedup + job state persistence)
#   COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY — UK officer address enrichment (optional but recommended)
