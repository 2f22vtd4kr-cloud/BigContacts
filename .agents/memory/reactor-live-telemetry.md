description: Durable rules for representing Atlas execution truthfully in the Intelligence Reactor UI
---

Atlas uses numbered checkpoints 0 through 10, so the UI should present eleven checkpoint states while retaining 10 as the phase maximum. Generic job `progress`/`total` cannot also represent the current entity batch: phase state, current entity names, and entity range/total must be separate structured fields.

**Why:** The orchestrator can overwrite generic job progress with bounded entity-batch counters while the overall phase is unchanged. Inferring one from the other makes the reactor show misleading phase numbers or entity activity.

**How to apply:** Keep phase state, entity-batch state, and live rod endpoints as distinct inputs. Historical sessions are output records, not reactor activity; idle mode must not animate waves or light synthesis rods. Feedback routes should light only when a live endpoint reports activity.

The Reactor's quick operational summary belongs in a persistent responsive header on both desktop and mobile. It should include the current checkpoint/live detail plus real database totals, hot leads, assets, research sessions, and outreach count; the idle state must not replace those totals with zeroes.

**Why:** Operators need progress and dataset context without scrolling, and zeroing valid totals during standby makes the UI look disconnected from the actual workspace.

**How to apply:** Use compact metric chips or a two-row mobile summary, keep the pipeline visualization below, and remove duplicate footer meters once the header carries the same information. For active target work, publish a target-scoped telemetry payload with stage, tool IDs, safe prompt purpose, evidence/result counts, and review status; parse malformed payloads as absent rather than inferring activity.

The reactor route must own its scroll region: the outer routed content wrapper should be non-scrolling while the mobile flow uses the available flex height and `overflow-y-auto`. Idle mode should state that Atlas is intentionally waiting, not imply a broken or disconnected reactor.

**Why:** Nested page-level and component-level scroll containers clipped the lower mobile phases, and a visually quiet manual pipeline looked inactive without an explicit standby explanation.

**How to apply:** When changing the reactor shell or layout, preserve `min-height: 0` through the flex chain, keep the route-specific outer wrapper from competing for scroll, and show live/standby status from the actual Atlas status endpoint.

Durable Reactor history should be emitted at orchestration/tool boundaries through an optional target-scoped sink and stored as capped job-log events; the sink must receive summaries and counts, never raw provider payloads or secrets.

**Why:** A single latest snapshot cannot explain what happened before the current poll, while instrumenting low-level providers directly can accidentally persist sensitive payloads or couple reusable enrichers to a specific UI.

**How to apply:** Keep reusable enrichers callback-based and optional, append structured `ATLAS_EVENT` records beside the latest snapshot, and render history as reviewable evidence of execution rather than proof that a candidate is valid.

The page-level Reactor render tree must derive scheduler props from the same live `atlasState.scheduler` snapshot that the poller constructs; never reference an undeclared parallel scheduler variable.

**Why:** The first continuous-scheduler UI wiring passed `scheduler` into mobile and desktop renderers without declaring it in the page component, producing a mobile Vite runtime overlay and hiding the entire Reactor.

**How to apply:** Keep one source of truth for scheduler state: set it from the successful `/api/ingest/atlas-status` response and pass `atlasState?.scheduler ?? null` to responsive renderers. Verify the actual `/reactor` route at a mobile viewport after scheduler UI changes.

Never apply a decorative `mask-image` fade to the mobile Reactor's scroll container; keep masks on static background layers only.

**Why:** iOS Safari applies the mask to the full scroll surface, fading lower evidence cards and the pipeline map so they appear unreadable even though scrolling still works.

**How to apply:** Preserve the grid background on the scroll container with a mask-free class, and verify a tall mobile viewport that reaches the final pipeline stages.

Keep actual public-source research tools visually separate from the deterministic persona review lane.

**Why:** Showing `persona-review` beside search providers and evidence tools made it look like another OSINT collector, obscuring that it only audits the persisted Phase J result.

**How to apply:** Label the first group `OSINT & Evidence` and describe it as public-source search/extraction/attribution. Label the second group `Post-research quality review` and explicitly state that the 11 personas do not search the web or add contacts; show this distinction outside collapsed details on mobile.
