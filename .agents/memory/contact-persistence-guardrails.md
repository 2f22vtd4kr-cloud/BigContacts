name: Contact persistence guardrails
description: Durable rule for keeping alternate writes and merges from bypassing public-contact validation.

Every path that persists or restores contact data must sanitize email, phone, and social values before writing PostgreSQL, evidence, Redis, or metadata. Never trust an incoming cached confidence score or a module-local score; recompute personal Access confidence from the cleaned vectors and entity type.

**Why:** Alternate enrichment routes, Redis restore, startup maintenance, and entity merge logic can otherwise reintroduce stale or invalid contacts after the primary enrichment path has been hardened.

**How to apply:** Keep the shared validators at every persistence boundary. On merges and maintenance, recompute contact outcome and `isHot` from the sanitized person-level direct vectors; pass entity type into every recomputation, and keep organization contacts and generic/shared channels outside personal Access.

This also applies to presentation boundaries: if stored legacy metadata says a corporation or trust has a personal outcome, API responses and ledger cards must normalize it to an organization route rather than exposing the stale label.

Registry-phone provenance must have a persisted schema field, not only a metadata convention. Backfill legacy metadata markers into that field before recomputing outcomes, confidence, or hot status.

**Why:** A legacy EDGAR phone source existed only in metadata while the recomputation path read a missing/blank structured source, allowing a registry switchboard to appear as a personal route.

**How to apply:** Keep the nullable `phone_source` column aligned with the Drizzle schema and pass it through every Atlas, enrichment, maintenance, merge, and reachability recomputation or provider-prompt path.

Reachability prompts must use the same sanitized, source-aware direct-contact classification as persistence scoring. A registry phone may remain useful organization evidence, but it cannot produce `DIRECT` telemetry or a direct-access research contract.

**Why:** A target-scoped canary exposed that Atlas's provider prompt omitted `phoneSource` even though persistence scoring already excluded EDGAR/Companies House phones, causing the model to receive a false direct-access instruction.

**How to apply:** Treat `phoneSource` as required context at every `assessTargetReachability` call, especially AI/deep-web prompt construction; add a regression test whenever a new reachability caller is introduced.
