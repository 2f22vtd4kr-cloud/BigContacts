name: Case Bureau architecture
description: Discovery-first and target-scoped investigation cases sit above adaptive research and preserve human review.
---

The Case Bureau is the durable coordination layer above the adaptive research director. A case begins as discovery when the human mission has no validated entity: it stores the Boss opening brief, broad initial research response, Boss commentary, source URLs, and review-only candidate context. A reviewed candidate can then be promoted into the same case as a target-scoped investigation with the existing shared case file, bounded specialist assignments, next-action queue, human directives, and append-only event trail.

**Why:** The investigation should adapt from evidence gaps without creating a parallel pipeline, while the human remains the final decision-maker for contact routes and prior evidence cannot be silently rewritten.

**How to apply:** Keep the initial local director provider-key independent and mark Gemini Boss mode pending until configured; when keys are added, use the centralized cost-safe `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` Boss model rather than Pro Preview. Connect future LLM directing to the same case/action/event contract. Preserve broad direct-to-organization route summaries as review-only evidence, and never let the bureau promote contacts, infer identity, or generate outreach.
