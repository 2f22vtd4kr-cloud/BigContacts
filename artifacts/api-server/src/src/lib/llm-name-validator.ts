/**
 * LLM-Backed Name Validator
 *
 * Provides Groq LLaMA admission gates for broad discovery and name-only
 * ingestion. Discovery uses the source context as well as the candidate name.
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 *   1. Regex pre-filter (fast, removes obvious corporate/fund names)
 *   2. LLM batch-filter (catches ambiguous cases like "Economic Affairs",
 *      "Reducing Marginal", "Please Appoint A", abstract concept pairs)
 *
 * The LLM call is fail-closed for broad discovery: if Groq is unavailable or
 * returns malformed output, no candidates are retained. A provider outage
 * must never turn search noise into HNWI records.

Return only the 1-based indices of candidates that pass ALL requirements:
1. The exact candidate name is a real, currently living human individual.
2. The source context explicitly attributes the qualifying claim to that exact person,
   not merely to a nearby company, venue, family, article author, employee, or other person.
3. The claim is a genuine ownership, beneficial ownership, founder, principal, investor,
   major shareholder, property/yacht/aircraft ownership, family-office, wealth, or
   equivalent principal claim.
4. The source context is not a recipe, editorial page, navigation/UI fragment, job listing,
   staff directory, service page, fictional/cultural reference, or generic organization text.
5. The query geography and source context are consistent enough to identify a real target;
   do not infer geography or wealth from the query alone.

Reject obvious false names such as role fragments ("Rocco Forte Deputy"), recipe/editorial
phrases ("Creamy Cucumber", "Tomato Salad"), venues, companies, titles, and names whose
only evidence is that someone else owns a business. When uncertain, reject. This is an
admission gate, not a lead generator.

Answer YES only when ALL three are true:
1. Real human being — not fictional, not a brand, not a venue name
2. Currently alive today — not deceased, not a historical figure
3. Private individual — not a world-famous celebrity, actor, musician, athlete, politician, head of state, or member of a royal family

Answer NO (exclude) if ANY of the following apply:
- FICTIONAL CHARACTER — e.g. "James Bond", "Jay Gatsby", "Gordon Gekko", "Jack Sparrow"
- DECEASED — anyone publicly known to have died: "George Mason" (1792), "Gar Wood" (1971), "Louis Comfort Tiffany" (1933), "Benjamin Franklin", "Napoleon Bonaparte", "Steve Jobs", "Princess Diana"
- ULTRA-FAMOUS public figure with no private-wealth angle — A-list celebrities, world leaders, royalty (e.g. "Elon Musk", "Taylor Swift", "King Charles")
- Company, venue, or organisation — contains LLC, Ltd, Corp, Marina, Hotel, Resort, Foundation, Group, Capital, Partners, Holdings, Trust, Club, Association, Council, Authority, Department, Circle, Society, Institute
- Government / public sector body — pension funds, public employees, retirement systems, municipal authorities, government agencies, school districts, police departments (e.g. "Colorado Public Employees", "Texas Teachers Retirement", "NYC Fire Department")
- Geographic place, ski resort, venue, or establishment — a named place that is not a person (e.g. "Serre Chevalier", "Port City Chop", "Queen Victoria" when used as a hotel/pub, "Connoisseur Circle")
- Deceased historical figure — monarchs, historical rulers, anyone who died before 1950 (e.g. "Queen Victoria", "Napoleon Bonaparte")
- Two people joined by "&" — e.g. "Edward & Carol Kaplan"
- Abstract concept or legal phrase — "Beneficial Owners", "Joint Venture", "Safe Harbor", "Ministerial Decree", "Due Diligence"
- Clearly truncated or a title — "The Chairman", "Mr Smith", single-word entries, all-initial strings
- Plural collective noun — "Past Commodores", "Private Bankers", "Senior Directors"

Real living businesspeople, family office principals, property developers, fund managers, and investors are YES even if modestly known.
Non-Western names (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc.) are YES when they look like a real individual's full name.

IMPORTANT: When unsure whether someone is alive or fictional — err on the side of NO. It is far better to miss one person than to insert a fictional character or deceased historical figure.
