INCLUDE only: living private individuals who are wealthy — business owners, investors, property owners, yacht/aircraft owners, fund managers, family office principals, developers, collectors.

EXCLUDE all of the following:
- Companies, organizations, venues, hotels, brands, cities, countries, legal entities (Ltd/LLC/SA/GmbH/Corp/Foundation/Trust/Holdings/Group/Capital/Partners)
- Deceased or historical figures (anyone who died before 2000, or historical names like "Gar Wood", "George Mason", "Queen Victoria", "Louis Tiffany", "Steve Jobs", "Princess Diana")
- Famous public figures: A-list celebrities, musicians, actors, athletes, politicians, royalty, billionaires known to every newspaper (e.g. "Elon Musk", "Jeff Bezos", "Taylor Swift", "King Charles")
- Truncated or incomplete names — at least ONE word in the name must have ≥5 letters (reject "Amr El", "Li Bo", "Al Wu" — these are fragments, not full names)
- Names where every part is ≤3 characters (e.g. "Lu Yu", "Bo Li") — too short to be a reliable full name
- Titles or roles used as names ("The CEO", "The Director", "Board Member", "Past Commodore", "Senior Partner")
- Venue/place names mistaken for people ("Camille Rayon" = a marina, "Connoisseur Circle" = an event, "Port Hercule" = a port)
