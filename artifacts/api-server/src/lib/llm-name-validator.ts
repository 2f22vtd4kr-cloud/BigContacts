/**
 * LLM-Backed Name Validator
 *
 * Replaces brittle hand-written regex rules with a Groq LLaMA call that
 * answers a single question: "Is this a human person's full name?"
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 *   1. Regex pre-filter (fast, removes obvious corporate/fund names)
 *   2. LLM batch-filter (catches ambiguous cases like "Economic Affairs",
 *      "Reducing Marginal", "Please Appoint A", abstract concept pairs)
 *
 * The LLM call is ALWAYS fail-open: if Groq is unavailable or rate-limited,
 * all candidates that passed the regex are accepted. This prevents the
 * validator from blocking ingestion when API keys are exhausted.

  const prompt = `You are a quality gate for a private-wealth OSINT database. Your job: decide whether each name is a REAL, CURRENTLY LIVING private individual who could plausibly be a high-net-worth research target.

Answer YES only when ALL three are true:
1. Real human being — not fictional, not a brand, not a venue name
2. Currently alive today — not deceased, not a historical figure
3. Private individual — not a world-famous celebrity, actor, musician, athlete, politician, head of state, or member of a royal family

Answer NO (exclude) if ANY of the following apply:
- FICTIONAL CHARACTER — e.g. "James Bond", "Jay Gatsby", "Gordon Gekko", "Jack Sparrow"
- DECEASED — anyone publicly known to have died: "George Mason" (1792), "Gar Wood" (1971), "Louis Comfort Tiffany" (1933), "Benjamin Franklin", "Napoleon Bonaparte", "Steve Jobs", "Princess Diana"
- ULTRA-FAMOUS public figure with no private-wealth angle — A-list celebrities, world leaders, royalty (e.g. "Elon Musk", "Taylor Swift", "King Charles")
- Company, venue, or organisation — contains LLC, Ltd, Corp, Marina, Hotel, Resort, Foundation, Group, Capital, Partners, Holdings, Trust, Club, Association, Council, Authority, Department, Circle, Society, Institute
- Government / public sector body — pension funds, public employees, retirement systems, municipal authorities, government agencies, school districts, police departments (e.g. "Colorado Public Employees", "Texas Teachers Retirement", "NYC Fire Department")
- Geographic place, ski resort, venue, or establishment — a named place that is not a person (e.g. "Serre Chevalier", "Port City Chop", "Queen Victoria" when used as a hotel/pub, "Connoisseur Circle")
- Deceased historical figure — monarchs, historical rulers, anyone who died before 1950 (e.g. "Queen Victoria", "Napoleon Bonaparte")
- Two people joined by "&" — e.g. "Edward & Carol Kaplan"
- Abstract concept or legal phrase — "Beneficial Owners", "Joint Venture", "Safe Harbor", "Ministerial Decree", "Due Diligence"
- Clearly truncated or a title — "The Chairman", "Mr Smith", single-word entries, all-initial strings
- Plural collective noun — "Past Commodores", "Private Bankers", "Senior Directors"

Real living businesspeople, family office principals, property developers, fund managers, and investors are YES even if modestly known.
Non-Western names (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc.) are YES when they look like a real individual's full name.

IMPORTANT: When unsure whether someone is alive or fictional — err on the side of NO. It is far better to miss one person than to insert a fictional character or deceased historical figure.
